## Synopsis

The following are a number of steps in R that will aggregate PUMS data from the census to determine
the changes in the number of School Age Children expected in new developments by housing type and size.

The data is specific to a certain area, and confined to those who have recently moved in within the past 5
years.


## Motivation

While creating a fiscal impact analysis for a county in SW Florida I came across the need to assess the difference
in school costs among 3 different scenarios.

To determine the expected number of School-Age Children (SAC) I needed to download PUMS data for the county and
determine the averages for different types and sizes of houses of those who recently moved into the county. The
result should show the differences in school costs based on zoning and development decisions that the county makes
over the next 20 years.

## Installation

You will have to have R and R Studio installed, as well as all of the listed packages.
